My personal website that I'm currently building. It utilizes [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to quickly build styled pages using markdown.

# Development notes:
* `public/` is where hugo builds the site to.
* `server/` holds a slightly modified version of [this](https://github.com/Rushmore75/rust_server_template) repository, making a quick static site server.
