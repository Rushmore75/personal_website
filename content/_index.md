Hello there!

## About me
<div>
<div class=left>

I'm a computer enthusiast from Montana, USA.

I've always had an interest in computers, I remember taking the PCB out of a calculator when I wash ≈5 and thinking I could make some cool hacker items with it!

Then my affinity for the game Minecraft lead me to modding the game. This funnels you straight toward learning Java.

A friend from church knew how to code in Java and he hosted his own servers! 

He started teaching me 2020. Since then I've also picked up languages such as Rust & Typescript. (Also a smattering of ≈10 other languages.)
