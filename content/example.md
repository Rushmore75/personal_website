This is what the pages can consist of! [^1]

Anything that markdown supports.

```java
public static void function() {
    var x = System.in.nextLine();
}
```
Then we can explain and what not. Then just after that we jump into another codeblock. **This** time with
a new language
```rust
fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {
    let x = x*x; 
    x
}
```
and somehow or another it knows how to highlight languages. I don't know if browsers have code highlighting built in or if that's something the hugo devs had to do. Because it seems to be something markdown supports by default.

[^1]: Footnote for that sentence.
